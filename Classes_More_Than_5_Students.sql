--Classes More Than 5 Students 

Table: Courses
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(student, class) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.
 

Find all the classes that have at least five students.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.
 

Example 1:
Input: 
Courses table:
+---------+----------+
| student | class    |
+---------+----------+
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+

Output: 
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
Explanation: 
- Math has 6 students, so we include it.
- English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.

--Create table Courses
CREATE TABLE Courses (
    student varchar(100),
    class varchar(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (student, class)
);

--Insert Courses Values
INSERT INTO Courses (student, class)
VALUES
    ('A', 'Math'),
    ('B', 'English'),
    ('C', 'Math'),
    ('D', 'Biology'),
    ('E', 'Math'),
    ('F', 'Computer'),
    ('G', 'Math'),
    ('H', 'Math'),
    ('I', 'Math');

--Solution 
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5
